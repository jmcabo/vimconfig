NOTES
-----

1) Help tags:

    -The first time, update help tags by running:

            :helptags ALL

     if the plugins doc/ are in root only writeable dirs, then run that from Vim as root.

2) Terminal colors:
       
    -Set the terminal to 256 colors (in each terminal app Profile, or in "/etc/profile.d/.." when TERM was "xterm"):
            
            export TERM='xterm-256color'
    
    -If the custom 16 palette colors cannot be customized, set this flag
     to 0 or v:false in colors/jmcdark.vim:

            let g:JmcDarkForce16ColorsInConsole=0

     That way, it will use the 256 color extended palette to get an approximation.

3) CtrlP keys:

            <C-f> or <C-Up>    Switch mode (MRU, files, buffers)
            <C-b> or <C-Down>  Switch mode the other way (MRU, files, buffers).
     
   VIM has two ways to organize files: Tabs and Buffers.
   Buffers are always there. Tabs are only there if one creates a new one,
   for example with:

            :tabnew

   What the terminal tab plugins for VIM do, is to show all the buffers as tabs.
   But as soon as a new tab is open, Airline plugin switches to show only tabs.
   To exit that mode, close all the tabs with:

            :tabclose or :tabc

   To list the tabs:

            :tabs

   To list the buffers:
            
            :ls
